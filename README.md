# HunterTalentGuide
## Info
This is an AddOn for World of Warcraft Vanilla (v.1.12), that will show hunter players what talent to choose. 
Based on wowhead's hardcore hunter guide : https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/hunter/hardcore-leveling-tips#leveling-tips

## Future
I'll try to create all the other classes guides soon enough, I'll link everything down here :
- [Warrior Guide](https://github.com/rmarc29/WarriorTalentGuide) 
- [Druid Guide](https://github.com/rmarc29/DruidTalentGuide) 

At the end my project is to try to create a single AddOn that will track which class you play so you won't have to constantly switch between them.
